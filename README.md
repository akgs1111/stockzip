StockZip is a lightweight Windows tool for organizing and creating ZIP files automatically.

📦 StockZip

StockZip is a lightweight Windows desktop tool that helps automate the process of organizing and zipping files — especially useful for designers and stock contributors who deal with repetitive file preparation.

❓ Why StockZip exists

If you upload assets regularly (graphics, illustrations, documents, etc.), you already know the routine:

Create folders

Organize files

Double-check formats

Zip everything

Repeat… again and again

The task itself isn’t hard — it’s repetitive.

After doing this manually for a long time, it became clear that this workflow didn’t need human attention every single time. That’s where StockZip comes in.

⚙️ What StockZip does

StockZip simplifies file preparation by:

Automatically organizing files into a clean folder structure

Creating ZIP files in one click

Reducing manual errors

Saving time on repetitive preparation work

It’s designed to stay out of the way and do one job well.

👤 Who it’s for

StockZip is useful if you are:

A graphic designer

A stock asset contributor

A freelancer uploading files regularly

Anyone who repeatedly prepares folders and ZIP archives

If you only zip files once in a while, built-in tools are enough.
If you do it daily or weekly, automation makes sense.

🧠 Philosophy

StockZip isn’t trying to be a complex platform or subscription service.

It exists for one simple reason:

If a task is mechanical and repeated often, it should be automated.
